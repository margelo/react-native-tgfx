/**
 * A node handle's bookkeeping, in native memory every runtime can read.
 *
 * A handle has to answer one question on every write — "does the mounted
 * program keep a value slot for this key?" — and it has to answer it on
 * whichever runtime the write came from: the JS thread, the UI thread, or a
 * camera frame processor.
 *
 * Keeping that answer in a Reanimated `SharedValue` cannot do it. A shared
 * value is hosted by one runtime: a write from anywhere else is applied later
 * and does not update the writer's own copy, so the thread that published the
 * answer reads back the previous one; and a read from a third runtime is a
 * *blocking* call into the host, taken on the calling thread — 8 per frame in
 * the face-blur screen, on the camera thread.
 *
 * So the answer lives in bytes instead. {@link flags} wraps a native
 * allocation, and Nitro hands each runtime its own `ArrayBuffer` over the *same
 * memory* — no copy, no publish, no staleness. A write is a store, a read is an
 * index, and every runtime sees the store immediately.
 *
 * One byte per key rather than one bit: a byte store is indivisible, so a
 * reader can never catch a half-written value, and no reader-writer lock is
 * needed for what is a single writer (the compiler, on the JS thread) and many
 * readers.
