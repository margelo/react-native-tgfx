/**
 * Writer for the binary draw-program the native engine consumes.
 *
 * The program is a flat `Float64Array` written in tree preorder, so compiling a
 * scene is a run of stores into one reused buffer — no intermediate objects and
 * no JSON. Strings (path data, text, image sources, shader source) are rare and
 * variable-width, so they travel beside the buffer in a string table and the
 * buffer holds their indices.
 *
 * Layout, in words:
 *
 *     [0] VERSION
 *     [1] total word count
 *     [2] first word of the slot-patch table
 *     [3..] node stream
 *     [patch table] count, then (wordIndex, slotIndex) pairs
 *
 * A field backed by a Reanimated SharedValue is written as 0 and recorded in the
 * patch table, so the engine knows which words to resolve against the live value
 * array each frame.
 *
 * After the numeric patch table sits the string-patch table (a count, then
 * (wordIndex, stringSlot) pairs): words whose string-table index is resolved
 * against the live string array pushed with `setStringValues`.

/**
 * Encode a string table as a delta against the one the engine already holds:
 * element 0 is the number of leading entries it keeps, the rest replaces
 * everything after them. Entries carry the payloads that scale with content
 * rather than node count — path data, text, shader source — and they are
 * byte-identical across commits, so re-sending them costs a Nitro marshal, a
 * UTF-8 conversion and a full hash scan per commit for nothing. Images are not
 * among them: they travel as an integer handle.
 * Decoded by applyStringTable() in cpp/Scene/SceneStrings.hpp.
