/**
 * Wrap a platform hardware buffer - an `AHardwareBuffer*` on Android, a

 * `frame.getNativeBuffer().pointer`.
 *
 * Zero-copy and synchronous: the buffer is imported straight to a GPU texture,
 * with no decode and no CPU round trip. For a stream of frames, keep the handle
 * and call `image.setNativeBuffer(...)` per frame - native code imports the new
 * buffer and replaces the registry entry, while the draw path resolves the
 * stable handle every frame. Nothing is re-committed, replacement schedules a
 * redraw, and an undrawn frame is superseded by the next rather than queued
 * behind it. The previous buffer is released on replacement; do not write into
 * a buffer while the handle still points at it.
 *
 * Such a handle is not accounted against the decoded-pixel budget: the memory
 * belongs to whoever produced the buffer.
 *
 * A worklet, so a camera frame processor can call it directly: the buffer is
 * only alive for the duration of the callback, so the handle has to be made
 * where the frame is, not hopped to the JS thread first.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Unlike every other function here, this one does **not** share the memoised
 * factory: a worklet gets its own copy of module state, so it builds a
 * `TgfxImageFactory` per call. That is deliberate and cheap for the intended
 * once-per-stream use, but it is not free - do not call it per frame. Use
 * `image.setNativeBuffer(...)` for the second and every later buffer.
 *
 * **`buffer` is a raw pointer, and nothing here can check it.** It is only
 * valid for as long as its producer says it is - for a VisionCamera frame, the
 * body of the `onFrame` callback. Passing a stale or already-released pointer
 * is a use-after-free that will not throw: it imports whatever memory is now at
 * that address. Never store one, never let one outlive the callback it came
 * from, and release the producer's own reference (`nativeBuffer.release()`)
 * only after this call, or `setNativeBuffer`, has returned.
